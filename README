This bash script goal is to get, during pentests, a proof of the risk of open/unprotected x11 server.

Based on xwd, this bash script takes pictures on a remote unprotected x11 server.
Pictures are took on a regular basis until the maximum frame count is reached or until the x11 connection is closed.
Pictures are assembled as a little movie.

TODO: calculate movie rate based on the delay between snaps.
TODO: implement range capture (prips ?)
